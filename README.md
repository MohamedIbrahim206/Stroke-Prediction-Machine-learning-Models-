# Stroke-Prediction-Machine-learning-Models-
### In this project we worked on a "Stroke Prediction" dataset to find a business solution. The project consists of the following:
1- Introduction 
<br/>
- In the introduction we provided a description for the columns of the dataset and a definition for the stroke and its symptoms.
<br/>
2- EDA
<br/>
- In this part we tried to find a relationship between the features and the target using Seaborn and matplotlib.
<br/>
<br/>
3- Dataset Preprocessing
<br/>
- This part includes handling missing values, handling outliers, encoding, scaling, features selection and handling imbalanced data.
<br/>
<br/>
4- Modeling 
<br/>
- We have applied Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Voting and K-Nearest Neighbor.
<br/>
<br/>
5- Business Solution
