# Stroke-Prediction-Machine-learning-Models-
### In this project we worked on a "Stroke Prediction" dataset to find a business solution. The project consists of the following:
1- Introduction 
<br/>
- In the introduction we provided a description for the columns of the dataset and a definition for the stroke and its symptoms.
<br/>
2- EDA
<br/>
- In this part we tried to find a relationship between the features and the target using Seaborn and matplotlib.
